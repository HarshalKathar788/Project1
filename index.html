        <strong>A Computer</strong> is an electronic device that is used to <strong>generate the output as per the userâ€™s input in a fast, efficient, and effective manner.</strong>It performs a sequence of operations, which is operating under the control of instructions stored in its memory. All these instructions will govern the machine.</p>

        <h2>What is a Computer?</h2>
        <p>
            A computer is an <strong>electronic device that is designed to process, store, and retrieve information.</strong> It can perform a variety of tasks based on instructions provided by a user or a program. Computers have become an essential part of our daily lives, and they are used in various fields such as education, business, entertainment, research, and communication.</p>
            <h2>History of Computer</h2>
         <ol type="1">
            <li>The history of computers can be traced back to the 19th century when Charles Babbage designed a machine called the Analytical Engine, which was intended to perform complex mathematical calculations. However, it was never completed. The first programmable computer was the Harvard Mark I, which was developed in the early 1940s. It was a massive machine that used punched cards for input and output.</li>
            <li>The first commercial computer was the UNIVAC I, which was introduced in 1951. It was used for tasks such as weather forecasting, scientific research, and business applications. Over the years, computers became smaller, faster, and more affordable, leading to the widespread use of personal computers in the 1980s and 1990s</li>
            <li>Modern computers are based on a digital circuitry system that uses binary code, which consists of ones and zeros, to represent data and instructions. The central processing unit (CPU) is the brain of the computer and performs all the processing operations. Input devices, such as a keyboard, mouse, or touchpad, allow users to input data into the computer. Output devices, such as a monitor or printer, display the processed data.</li>
            <li>Computers use a variety of storage devices, such as hard disk drives, solid-state drives, or flash memory, to store data and programs. They also use various software applications, including operating systems, productivity software, and entertainment programs.</li>
            <li>In recent years, advancements in technology have led to the development of new types of computers, such as smartphones, tablets, and wearable devices. These devices have revolutionized the way we interact with technology and have further integrated computers into our daily lives.</li>
         </ol>
         <h2>How Computer Works?</h2>
         <p>The motherboard is the most essential part of the computer as it holds the CPU and many primary components together required for processing. A computer receives data through an input unit based on the instructions it is given and once it gets any form of input from the user and then stores all the data on to RAM, Random Access Memory is a computer component where data used by the operating system and software applications are being stored so that the CPU can process them quickly.</p>
         <p>Everything stored on RAM is lost if the computer is shut off. There is a maximum limit of Random Access Memory(RAM) you will need for the computer to function properly. Now, the CPU will be fetching the data from the RAM process it with the specified instructions, and giving signals out to other components through BUS when the data is ready, it will be sent back through an output device which can be a monitor, speaker, printer, ports, etc.
